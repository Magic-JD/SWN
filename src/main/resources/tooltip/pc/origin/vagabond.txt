Vagabond
A dilettante has money and friends; your hero simply has the road. Whether they were knocked loose from polite society at a young age or have recently found themselves cast out of a familiar life, they now roam the ways of the world and the spaces between. Some heroes find this life satisfying, with its constant novelty and the regular excitement of bare survival. Others long for a more stable arrangement, and are willing to lend their pragmatic talents to a group that offers some prospect of profit.
