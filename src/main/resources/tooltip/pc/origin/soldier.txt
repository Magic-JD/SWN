Soldier
Whatever the technology or structure of their parent world, a soldier’s work is universal. Your hero was a professional fighter, whether that took the form of a barbarian noble’s thegn, a faceless conscript in a planetary army, or an elite soldier in the service of a megacorp’s private military. Whether it was because they were on the losing side, choosing to leave the service, or being forced to flee a cause they couldn’t fight for, they now find themselves navigating a world where their most salable skill is one that can cause them a great deal of trouble.
