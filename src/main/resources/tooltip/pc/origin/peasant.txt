Peasant
A technologically-advanced world can usually produce all its necessary foodstuffs and basic resources with a handful of workers, the bulk of the labor being performed by agricultural bots. On more primitive worlds, or those with a natural environment that requires close personal attention to crops, a class of peasants will emerge. These men and women often become chattel, part and parcel of the land they occupy and traded among their betters like the farm equipment of richer worlds. Your hero was not satisfied with that life, and has done something to break free from their muddy and toilsome past.
