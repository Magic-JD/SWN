Spacer
Almost every advanced world is highly dependent upon the resources that space flight brings them. Some of this work can be automated, but every really important task needs a flexible human operator to oversee the work. Your hero is one such spacer, either a worker who toils in the sky or a native voidborn man or woman who has spent their entire life outside of natural gravity. It's not uncommon for such workers to find better prospects in places where they can breathe without a vacc suit.
