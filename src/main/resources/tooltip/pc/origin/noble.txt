Noble
Many planets are ruled by a class of nobles, and your hero was a member of one such exalted group. Such planets are often worlds of exquisite courtesy alloyed with utterly remorseless violence, and a misplaced word at the morning levee can result in an executioner's monoblade at noon. Your hero has done something or been the victim of something to dislodge them from their comfortable place at court. Without their familiar allies, wealth, or influence, they must take a new place in the world, however distasteful that claiming might be.
