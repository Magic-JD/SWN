Merchant
Your hero was or is a trader. Some merchants are mere peddlers and shopkeepers on primitive, lowtech worlds, while others are daring far traders who venture to distant worlds to bring home their alien treasures. The nature of trade varies widely among worlds. On some of them, it's a business of soberly-dressed men and women ticking off trades on virtual terminals, while on others it is a moreâ€¦ active pursuit, requiring the judicious application of monoblades and deniable gunfire against competitors. Sometimes a deal goes bad or capital needs to be raised, and a merchant's natural talents are turned toward the perils of adventure.
