Scholar
Scientists, sages, and professors all qualify under this career. Your hero was one such, a man or woman with a life dedicated to knowledge and understanding. It might have involved the technical expertise of a metadimensional structures engineer or the sacred memorization of the chronicles of some lostworlder sage-order, but your hero's life was in learning. Sometimes that learning cannot be found in familiar surroundings, however, and for one reason or another, willing or not, your hero must venture out into the wider world.
