Politician
The nature of a political career varies from world to world. On some, it's much like one we'd recognize, with glad-handing voters, loud rallies, and quiet back room deals with supposed rivals in government. On others, it might involve a great deal more ceremonial combat, appeals to councils of elders, and success at ritual trials. Whatever the details, your hero was a politician in their home culture. Something went wrong, though, and the only way to fix it is to get clear of your constituents for a while and seek some alternative means of advancement.
