Entertainer
Singers, dancers, actors, poets, writers… the interstellar reaches teem with artists of unnumbered styles and mediums, some of which are only physically possible with advanced technological support. Your hero was a dedicated entertainer, one likely focused in a particular form of art. Patrons and talent scouts can be temperamental, however, and sometimes a budding artist needs to take steps to find their audience. Or at least, to find their audience’s money.
