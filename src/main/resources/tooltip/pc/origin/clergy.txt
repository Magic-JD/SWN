Clergy
Faith is nigh-universal among human civilizations, and your hero is dedicated to one such belief. Some clergy are conventional priests or priestesses, while others might be cloistered monastics or nuns, or more martial warrior-monks. Modern-day faiths such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and other creeds all exist in various sectors, often in altered form, while some worlds have developed entirely new deities or faiths. If you'd like to create your own religion, you can work with the GM to define its characteristic beliefs.
