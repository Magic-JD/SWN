Worker
Countless in number, every industrialized world has swarms of workers to operate the machines and perform the labor that keeps society functioning. Cooks, factory laborers, mine workers, personal servants, lawyers, clerks, and innumerable other roles are covered under this career. If your hero rolls or picks Work as a skill but has a career that would better fit another existing skill, they may substitute it accordingly. Thus, a wage-slave programmer might take Program instead of Work, while a lawyer would use Administer instead as a reflection of their litigious talent.
